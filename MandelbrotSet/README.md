# Mandlebrot Set Visualization

*I have preserved this high school project as-is, only recently adding this readme.*

## Overview

This project is an interactive visualization of the Mandelbrot set. The true Mandelbrot set (the pure black part of the image)
is defined as the set of complex numbers $c$ for which the equation $f(z) = z^2 + c$ does not diverge when iterated.
It is a mathematical fact that any complex number iterated in this way whose magnitude is greater than two will
eventually diverge, so for practical purposes the value two can be used as a cutoff.
A point is considered to have not diverged if its magnitude remains less than two for a large number of finite iterations,
the exact number of which depends on the current zoom level.

The famous colors of the fractal are generated by color-coding the number of iterations in takes a starting point
to "escape" the threshold of two. A lot of care was put into the color interpolation to get a visually pleasing gradient.

This application was written in Java, and is not the fastest. It would be interesting to see the speedup that could come
from converting to C++, or using the GPU for the repetitive calculations that occur at every pixel.


## Usage Instructions

* Click with the mouse to center the visualization on that point.
* Pressing the number keys 1-5 will zoom out, with 1 zooming out the most and 5 the least.
* Pressing the keys 6-0 will zoom in, with 6 zooming the least and 0 the most.
* Pressing \ will reset to the default zoom and view.
