# Genetic Algorithm Dots

An early experiment with genetic algorithms. The goal of the dots is to reach the goal, the large green dot.
A dot's genome encodes a series of directions it will move. Dots that are fitter (get closer to the goal) are able to reproduce
to produce offspring, which works by combining two dot's genomes with random mutations. Children dots
inherit their parents' colors as well.
